Briefly describe what my application will do. 
**********************************************
-Create a list of songs that a user wants to listen to. 

-Will connect to Spotify's API (unless there is an easier song API out there) to obtain songs data. 

-Will use google authorization to login in users. 

Type of data should be SAVED in the application
**********************************************

Tables + 
---------------------------------------------
1.) Artists

3.) To_Listen_to
